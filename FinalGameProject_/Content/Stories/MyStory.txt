Son: Heh~
Dad: Smile and laugh, just like a Harley
Son: Dad, am I attractive?
dad: ……?
Son: Today a girl in our class gave me a lollipop
Dad: So what?
Son: Dad, are you straight? So she likes me.
Dad: I saw Erwazi's instagram,
didn't she give it to everyone on her birthday?
Son: Heh~ Dad, how about you say you're a straight,
do you understand girls'little thoughts?
dad: ……
Son: Girl, if she give me a lollipop alone,
she will definitely be shy,
so she took this opportunity and pretended to distribute it to everyone,
but in fact, ah~ just wanted to give to me.
Dad: Are you thinking a little too much?
Son: Heh~ Impossible. The candy she gave me was strawberry-flavored.
She must have secretly checked that I like strawberries.
Dad: Just because of this?
Son: That's what it's called, a high-quality single man like me,
but any girl, it's impossible for her to have no thoughts about me.
Dad: Tsk...
Son: This girl has a delicate mind~ I have only known me for two weeks,
and she know that I like strawberries.
Son: You have raised me for eighteen years,
but you still don't know that I like strawberries.
dad: ……
Son: LOL~
